* Formulas: `IF`, `SUMIFS`, basic arithmetic
* Pivot Tables and Slicers
* Charts: Bar chart, Line chart
* Conditional Formatting and Filters

📌 What Was Done

* Cleaned the dataset: removed duplicates and empty rows, corrected formatting
* Created new calculated columns (e.g., Net Profit, Discount Flag)
